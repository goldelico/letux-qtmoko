QtMoko and Freesmartphone
=========================

* This is my log and notes about porting QtMoko on Freesmartphone.org
  framework.


QtMoko on SHR rootfs
====================

* In fact you can skip this step because we will do the development on PC

* Easiest way for getting started is to use rootfs from shr-project.org. They
  already use FSO for telephony and they always have most recent versions.

* For qtmoko running on SHR rootfs you need to compile with bluetooth disabled.
  I suppose you know how to build qtmoko, if not check README [1]. The
  configure command will be:

../qtmoko/configure -device neo -remove-module bluetooth

* Pack it up and transfer the contents of /opt to SHR rootfs and launch it:

../qtmoko/devices/neo/scripts/update_qtmoko

ssh root@192.168.0.202
. /opt/qtmoko/qpe.env
qpe


Develop on PC
=============

* FSO uses dbus as communication transport. Thankfully dbus calls can be
  redirected from phone to PC. Nice tutorial is here [1].

* First install latest SHR unstable

* SSH to your phone running SHR unstable and do:

dbus-daemon-proxy --system --port 8081

* On your PC do:

export DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS=tcp:host=192.168.0.202,port=8081
mdbus2 --system

  and you will see dbus interface of your phone. This interface we will call
  from our QT dialer/SMS handler etc...


Blinking LEDS
=============

* We will start with something very simple - blinking with leds. Let's see how
  we can do this from command line on your phone.

* mdbus2 is the best command line tool for calling dbus. FSO is running on
  system bus. Let's check this:

ssh root@192.168.0.202

root@om-gta02 ~ # mdbus2 --system
net.connman
org.freedesktop.DBus
org.freedesktop.Gypsy
org.freesmartphone.frameworkd
org.freesmartphone.oaudiod
org.freesmartphone.odatad
org.freesmartphone.odeviced
org.freesmartphone.oeventsd
org.freesmartphone.ogpsd
org.freesmartphone.ogsmd
org.freesmartphone.opimd
org.freesmartphone.opreferencesd
org.freesmartphone.otimed
org.freesmartphone.ousaged
org.freesmartphone.testing
org.openmoko.projects.ffalarms.atd
org.shr.phonefso

* As you can see, there are plenty of busses listed, let's explore the one we
  are most interested in:

root@om-gta02 ~ # mdbus2 --system org.freesmartphone.odeviced

/org/freesmartphone/Device/Input/1
/org/freesmartphone/Device/Input/0
/org/freesmartphone/Device/Display
/org/freesmartphone/Device/Display/0

* Above are listed all available objects that we can call, so let's choose the
  blue led device:

root@om-gta02 ~ # mdbus2 --system org.freesmartphone.odeviced /org/freesmartphone/Device/LED/gta02_blue_power
[METHOD]    org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.Get( s:interface_name, s:property_name ) -> ( v:value )
[METHOD]    org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.GetAll( s:interface_name ) -> ( a{sv}:properties )
[METHOD]    org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.Set( s:interface_name, s:property_name, v:value ) -> ()
[SIGNAL]    org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.PropertiesChanged( s:interface_name, a{sv}:changed_properties, as:invalidated_properties )
[METHOD]    org.freedesktop.DBus.Introspectable.Introspect() -> ( s:xml_data )
[METHOD]    org.freedesktop.DBus.Peer.Ping() -> ()
[METHOD]    org.freedesktop.DBus.Peer.GetMachineId() -> ( s:machine_uuid )
[METHOD]    org.freesmartphone.Device.LED.SetBrightness( i:brightness ) -> ()
[METHOD]    org.freesmartphone.Device.LED.SetBlinking( i:on_duration, i:off_duration ) -> ()
[METHOD]    org.freesmartphone.Device.LED.BlinkSeconds( i:seconds, i:on_duration, i:off_duration ) -> ()
[METHOD]    org.freesmartphone.Device.LED.SetNetworking( s:interface, s:mode ) -> ()

* Result above is list of callable methods, now we can use SetBrightness to
  turn on/off the led:

mdbus2 --system org.freesmartphone.odeviced /org/freesmartphone/Device/LED/gta02_blue_power org.freesmartphone.Device.LED.SetBrightness 255

* The blue led should turn off:

mdbus2 --system org.freesmartphone.odeviced /org/freesmartphone/Device/LED/gta02_blue_power org.freesmartphone.Device.LED.SetBrightness 0


QT bindings for FSO
===================

* We can use FSO for turning on/off leds from command line on your phone. We
  will now do it from Qt/C++ program.

* QT can autogenerate C++ files for calling dbus. The tool is called
  qdbusxml2cpp. As input it needs XML files that describe dbus objects.

* FSO maintains XML descriptions for their dbus objects in git:

http://git.freesmartphone.org/?p=aurora.git;a=summary

* You have to clone that git and build it with:

./autogen.sh
make
make install

* Resulting XML description files are in xml folder. You can try to generate
  e.g. our LED interface:

qdbusxml2cpp -p org.freesmartphone.Device.LED org.freesmartphone.Device.LED.xml

* QtMoko has script for generating all FSO APIs in src/libraries/qfso


QT program for LEDS
===================

* You can open FSO bindings from and example program in QtCreator. It's in
  QtMoko's git under libraries/qfso/test.

* It should built just fine. Now you need dbus-daemon-proxy running on your
  phone (see above) and you need to tell QtCreator to connect to that proxy. In
  "Projects" you have to set:

DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS to tcp:host=192.168.0.202,port=8081

  you can check it also in screenshot creator_dbus_proxy_env.png

* If you run the program and have correct environment then dbus-daemon-proxy
  program should inform you about new connection when you press led checkbox
  and leds should turn on/off.


GSM
===

* qdbusxml2cpp can't automatically generate functions with more complicated
  types in signature. As a workaround, you can delete such methods from xml.

* Another way how to fix these errors is appending something like:

<annotation name="com.trolltech.QtDBus.QtTypeName.Out0" value="QVariantMap"/>

  before the problematic type.
