Cross compling from sources in debian chroot
============================================

  * The most easy and painless way is to build QtMoko in debian squeeze chroot.

  * You will need debian on your PC

  * Clone current git tree:

git clone git://github.com/radekp/qtmoko.git

  * Initialize and update submodules

cd qtmoko
git submodule init
git submodule update

  * Create and enter debian chroot:

sudo scripts/qtmoko-chroot.sh

  * Build it:
  
cd /root/qte/build
../qtmoko/configure -build-qt -device gta04
make
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/root/qte/build/qtopiacore/host/lib/
make install

  * If you have e.g. 8 core processor you can speed it up by passing -j8 arg
    to configure and make.

  * Upload the result to your device (you must have phone and usb network up)

../qtmoko/devices/gta04/scripts/update_qtmoko


Cross compiling without chroot
==============================
  
  * This is not supported anymore, but if you know what you are doing you can
    go on...

  * You will need Debian wheezy on your PC
  
  * Install required packages on your host PC:
  
apt-get build-dep libqt4-dev
apt-get install libqt4-dev libv4l-dev libdbus-1-dev libqt4-sql-sqlite
  
  * We will use emdebian toolchain, check this page:
  
        http://wiki.debian.org/EmdebianToolchain
        
  * Add emdebian apt repos and also sqeeze repos for older packages:
  
apt-get install emdebian-archive-keyring
echo "deb http://ftp.cz.debian.org/debian/ squeeze main contrib non-free" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
echo "deb http://www.emdebian.org/debian wheezy main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
apt-get update

  * Install armel cross compiler:
  
apt-get install g++-4.4-arm-linux-gnueabi

  * Install xapt and libraries qtmoko depens on:
  
apt-get install xapt
xapt -a armel -m libxext-dev libasound2-dev libdbus-1-dev libssl-dev libts-dev libbluetooth-dev libxtst-dev libpng12-dev libjpeg8-dev libv4l-dev libqt4-sql-sqlite libspeexdsp-dev libglib2.0-dev libsqlite3-dev libgstreamer0.10-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev

  * Make sure that there is no libqt4 installed in /usr/arm-linux-gnueabi
    because QtMoko build can link agains that qt-x11 and will not work.

  * Make link for dbus.h:
  
cd /usr/arm-linux-gnueabi/include
ln -s dbus-1.0/dbus dbus

  * Clone current git tree:

git clone git://github.com/radekp/qtmoko.git

  * Initialize and update submodules

cd qtmoko
git submodule init
git submodule update

  * Create build directory (you cant build from the git directory)

mkdir ../build
cd ../build

  * Build it:

../qtmoko/configure -device neo
make
make install

  * Upload the result to your device (you must have phone and usb network up)

../qtmoko/devices/neo/scripts/update_qtmoko

  * If you want translations to various languages you need to checkout
    the translations git branch:

git checkout origin/translations -b translations


PC build
========

    * It's now possible to build QtMoko for x86 without cross compiling. This
    is great for development. Just do:
    
../qtmoko/configure -device pc
make
make install

    * To run the image you need to be root and symlink the result image to opt:
    
cd /opt
ln -s /home/radek/qte/build-pc/image qtmoko

    * Now switch to first console (CTRL+ALT+F1) and run it:

. /opt/qtmoko/qpe.env
qpe


Old way
=======

  * Make sure you have installed on your host PC: libqt4-dev, libv4l-dev

  * You can also do fetch all build dependecies for qt:

apt-get build-dep libqt4-dev

  * Download and install toolchain

cd /
sudo wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/qtmoko/files/Toolchain/qtmoko-debian-toolchain-armv4t-eabi.tar.gz/download -O qtmoko-debian-toolchain-armv4t-eabi.tar.gz
sudo tar xzvpf qtmoko-debian-toolchain-armv4t-eabi.tar.gz

  * If you are on x86_64 you will need to download following 32bit libraries:

libmpfr1ldbl_XXX_i386.deb
libgmp3c2_XXX_i386.deb

     and extract the libraries from these package to /usr/lib32

  * Clone current git tree:

git clone git://github.com/radekp/qtmoko.git

  * Initialize and update submodules

cd qtmoko
git submodule init
git submodule update

  * Create build directory (you cant build from the git directory)

mkdir ../build
cd ../build

  * Build it:

../qtmoko/configure -force-build-qt -device neo
make
make install

  * Upload the result to your device (you must have phone and usb network up)

../qtmoko/devices/neo/scripts/update_qtmoko

  * If you want translations to various languages you need to checkout
    the translations git branch:

git checkout origin/translations -b translations


Compiling natively on ARM
=========================

* You need ARM device with a lot of storage 512MB of RAM (or 256MB + swap)

* Working devices are e.g. N900 or qemu armel buildhost.

* Basic buildhost can be downloaded from here:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/qtmoko/files/BuildHost/

* Install dependencies on build host:

apt-get build-dep libqt4-dev
apt-get install libdbus-1-dev libts-dev libbluetooth-dev libasound2-dev

* Get QtMoko sources:

git clone git://github.com/radekp/qtmoko.git

  * Initialize and update submodules

cd qtmoko
git submodule init
git submodule update

  * Create build directory (you cant build from the git directory)

mkdir ../build
cd ../build

  * Build it:

../qtmoko/configure -device neo -xplatform linux-native-g++ -l dbus-1 -I /usr/include/dbus-1.0/ -I /usr/lib/dbus-1.0/include
make
make install
